                <h3>THE RULES</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>First rule :</span> Choose your 3 characters at random for the first 3 different fights,
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Second rule :</span> The jokers, of which there are 3, can only be used for the first
                        rule, you can change your character with it,</li>

                    <li><span>Third rule :</span>
                        After the first 3 fights, choose your single favourite character to do 3 more fights,
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><span>Fourth rule :</span> the winner is the one with the most wins in total (the possibility of
                        a draw).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>NOTE: if when selecting characters (random or not) you don't have the character in the game and you
                    don't have a joker to change character, you automatically lose</p>
